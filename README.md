# Microsoft-Academic-Graph-Analysis
This is a research project on Microsoft Academic data done by a team led by Dr. Junpei Komiyama (Hajime Shimao, Micheal Price, Junge Zhang, Maria Riolo and Helena Miton).

For field-specific code, I only include code for computer science as example source code. Similar code are also executed for all other Level 0 fileds(as defined in Microsoft Academic data).
